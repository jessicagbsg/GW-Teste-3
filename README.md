# GW-Teste-3
In this challenge I nwas supposed to create a single page with a button in it and when the button was clicked it was supposed to fill a box selection by requiring a JSON file using AJAX.

## About the project
  Developed the visual part using ``HTML`` and ``CSS``; and used ``JQuery, JSON and AJAX`` to make the interactions and the logic behind. When there is a click on the button "Popular caixa", a filled box selection is displayed. 

### Running the project
To run/open the project, you just have to download the files and open it with your browser/editor. 

To edit or make changes, you have to download the whole project folder and edit as you like with your favorite IDE.
